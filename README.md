# THANKS!!
## Notes:
1. Thanks for the assignment. It was a lot of fun!
2. I would normally work with React instead of raw HTML, but it seemed like you were expecting that. Let me know if you would like me to re-implement in React (or another framework--I'm always happy to learn something new!)
3. Make sure to submit the "Schedule a Demo" form to see a surprise!!
4. Spoiler alert - the surprise is animated confetti! I probably could have found somebody else's (better) code for this, but I loved solving it myself and thought it would be a good opportunity to showcase my use of OOP principles(js classes), albeit very briefly. I realize this was whimsical and would not be appropriate for production, but the instructions said be creative.
