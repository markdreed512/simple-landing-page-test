# THANKS!!
##Notes: 
1. Thanks for the assignment. It was a lot of fun!
2. I would normally work with React instead of raw HTML, but it seemed like you were expecting that. Let me know if you would like me to re-implement in React (or another framework--I'm always happy to learn something new!)
3. Make sure to submit the "Schedule a Demo" form to see a surprise!!
